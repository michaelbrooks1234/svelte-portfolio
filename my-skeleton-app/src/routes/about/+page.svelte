            As I mentioned on the landing page, I am a self taught software engineer. I am very passionate about my work and I am proud to have made it into the field.
            I started out by learning Python and swiftly moved on to practicing data structure & algorithm coding problems while using C++.
            I then moved on to learning practical applications by focusing on web development and making web apps.

            While working my dayjobs I was also working on improving my qualifications as a SWE, this paid off by landing me my position as a client success engineer at Chili Publish.
            I was able to really focus on improving my wed development skills, especially with network requests and APIs. After my time at Chili Publish I became a Software Developer
            at Sekady. Here, I had the chance to focus on what I really wanted which was building out new features across the frontend and the backend.

            Now I have the skills and experience to build out entire web applications and I plan on seeing what I can create using this knowledge, as well as just improving as a Software Engineer.
            First things first is creating a well built portfolio to showcase my awesome (hopefully) work. I am not a designer, so hopefully I can manage to make everything look some what nice.
            I also have a few ideas for practical apps that will hopefully be good enough to monetize, but that's just a bonus.

            I have a single end goal and that is to become a very good Software Engineer. I have a few things that I want to excel at specifically. #1 would be having job specific knowledge.
            I believe that I have already made leaps and bounds in this regards due to my professional experience, but I want to take a deeper dive on the technologies that I use to build out applications.
            End goal #2 would definitely be getting very good with Data Structures and Algorithms. This is just something I want to be good at. Here is some people that inspire me:
